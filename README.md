# Group Meeting Email System

Two tables: 1). store the student email address, 2). store this week's presenter and upload ppt time.



We select the email based on the student name (primary key), and then compute the time.



For the frontend, I would like to use https://pro.ant.design/zh-CN/docs/getting-started/. So that, we can support more functions:

1. For each student we counted the number of presentations they made
2. Add new student account
3. Auto suggestion, when sending email to student

## Future Functions

1. Staff rate student’s presentation on the web
2. Auto counting the score for every student’s presentation

3. Add manager account
